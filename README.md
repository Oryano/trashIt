# trashIt

## Where do I throw it?
A common question when throwing something to a recycable container...
Separating trash for recycling is easier than we imagine.

## There is no standard...
There arn't so many rules, but unfortunately they vary from one place to another. Country to country, municipality to municipality, sometimes even within cities.
The colors of the bins, the types of containers, the symbols and the signs are not consistent and not uniform. 
Some places dont have established collection set up (e.g. offices).
This is what lead to the understanding of a need and then the idea of this API.


## trashIt is
* A searchable database online.
* An open database that changes and grow through user input.
* A place of infrmation that will clarify a system that only a tiny end of it is exposed to all of us users.
* A tool to consult with and to clarify confusions.
* An open tool for creative use of it's information which may educate and bring awarness to the subject.
